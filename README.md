# Endeavors

Endeavors helps you track and evaluate how you're spending your time.

- Link **activities** (e.g., bicycle riding, napping, etc) with **values** (e.g., experiencing nature, spending time with friends, etc), using a weighted point system
- Track the activities you act on each day
- View reports/visualizations to evaluate how you're spending your time and be encouraged to pursue the things that matter to you
